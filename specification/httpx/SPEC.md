## WebSocket Protocol: x-kaazing-handshake

### Abstract

This document specifies the behavior of a WebSocket protocol called the "Kaazing WebSocket Handshake Protocol" (KHP).  It can be used to enable extended WebSocket capabilities for WebSocket clients. It is intended for use with native WebSocket implementations.

### Requirements

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

### Introduction

The WebSocket protocol [[WSP][WSP]] defines notions of extension and sub-protocols.
[Section 1.9](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-1.9) of [WSP] specifies that "WebSocket subprotocols" can be negotiated at time of initial handshake. This document describes a new Kaazing-specific sub-protocol whose role is to define an additional handshake, allowing the client to negotiate additional capabilities, loosely called "extensions", or "application-class extensions" to distinguish these from [WSP] extensions.

The intention of this document is to define a WebSocket sub-protocol, named "x-kaazing-handshake" that allows for negotiation of available Kaazing-specific capabilities that will work over established native WebSocket connections.

The extended handshake defined in this document provides an opportunity for clients to negotiate application-class extensions after the WebSocket is established but before the application puts the WebSocket to use.

### Protocol Handshake Requirements

This section describes the handshake requirements necessary for establishing a WebSocket that speaks the KHP subprotocol.

There are two handshake request/response message pairs between a client and a server to establish a KHP WebSocket. The first request/response message pair is called the "Opening" handshake and is a standard WebSocket opening handshake using the HTTP protocol. This is to establish the raw WebSocket and to ensure that the KHP is the chosen protocol.

The second message pair is called the "Extended" handshake; messages are sent using WebSocket messages over the established raw WebSocket. The WebSocket is not said to be _open_ until the second message pair has successfully completed.

An "extended" handshake MUST be required when KHP is the chosen protocol during the "opening" handshake.

#### Handshake Requirements for the Opening WebSocket Handshake

To negotiate the use of KHP, the WebSocket client MUST include the following sub-protocol value within the raw WebSocket handshake:

	x-kaazing-handshake

For example, the following header would be sufficient:

	Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: x-kaazing-handshake, amqp, ...

The rules defined in [WSP] apply to the server receiving such a WebSocket opening handshake.

If the server does agree to use the x-kaazing-handshake protocol, <sup>[[a]]()</sup>the server MUST send back a |Sec-WebSocket-Protocol| header field containing x-kaazing-handshake in its response.




#### Handshake Requirements for the Extended WebSocket Handshake

The extended handshake requires a WebSocket message from client to server ("extended handshake request"), followed by a server response to the client ("extended handshake response"). The extended handshake MUST only commence when the client and server successfully negotiate the "x-kaazing-handshake" protocol in the opening handshake.

No other messages should be sent by client or server until the _extended handshake is completed_<sup>

The extended handshake WebSocket payloads take the form of HTTP Requests (for extended handshake requests) and HTTP Responses (for extended handshake responses) following the HTTP 1.1 protocol [RFC 2616].

| Web Socket Frame |
| Http Request/Response |


If protocol negotiation was specified in the opening handshake, any protocols requested other than "x-kaazing-handshake" MUST be included in the extended handshake request as values in the header:

	Sec-WebSocket-Protocol:

If any WebSocket extensions were requested but not negotiated successfully in the opening handshake, then the client MUST include any such extensions inside extended handshake request as values in the header:

	Sec-WebSocket-Extensions

The "Sec-WebSocket-Extensions" header MUST contain a non-empty list of extension names which the client desires, in an order of client preference, with the same semantics for the header as [WSP].

For example, inclusion of the following headers in the HTTP request payload within the first extended handshake request message indicates the client wishes to use a compression extension:

	Sec-WebSocket-Extensions: x-kaazing-compression

In the case that they are required, a client MAY include other headers in the first WebSocket message along with those above. This allows extension-specific information to be communicated between client and server without the need for additional handshakes.

A WebSocket server receiving the extended handshake message MUST respond with an extended handshake response message.

In the case where the extended handshake contains an extension that was already negotiated in the opening handshake, the server MUST detect that condition and respond in error before _Closing the WebSocket Connection_.

The extended handshake response contains a HTTP status code which may or may not be "actionable", as defined in a separate section below. When the extended handshake response has an HTTP status code that is not actionable, it is said that the _extended handshake failed_.

The actionable HTTP status codes are referenced in a separate section below. For the sake of example, some interesting response codes and their interpretation when seen in an extended handshake response are detailed in the table below.


| Extended Handshake Response Code | Behavior |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| 101 Switching Protocols | Clients receiving a 101 extended response SHOULD consider the _extended handshake completed_. |
| 302 Temporary Redirect | The server MUST _Close the WebSocket Connection_ following the definition in [WSP] after sending a 302 or 307 extended response.  Clients receiving a 302 or 307 extended response MUST complete the WebSocket close handshake following the definition in [WSP], and proceed with a fresh opening handshake to the URL specified in the Location: header of the extended handshake response.  The client should make no more than a fixed maximum number of reconnect attempts when faced with these redirect codes.  Additionally, client is responsible for detecting redirect loops to matching resources and avoiding reconnection attempts in such scenarios. |
| 401 Unauthorized | Clients receiving a 401 extended response SHOULD continue the extended handshake, and reply with a replayed extended handshake request containing additional authorization information.  If the client fails to reply in a timely manner, it is the serverâ€™s responsibility to _Close the WebSocket Connection_. |

The extended handshake response MAY include these headers:

        Sec-WebSocket-Extensions

The "Sec-WebSocket-Extensions" header if present MUST contain a non-empty list of extensions, chosen from the requested extensions by the client and no others, which are to be used for further client-server communication.  If the "Sec-WebSocket-Extensions" header is not present, no extensions were negotiated and none apply.  Where there are no conflicts, the standard interpretation of this header as defined in [WSP] should also apply.

In the case that they are required, the server MAY include other headers in the WebSocket response message along with those above.  This allows information to be communicated from  server to client, in particular any reasons for failure.

The client then receives the extended handshake response message.  The client must _Close the WebSocket Connection_ following the definition in [WSP] if any of the following are true:
* the raw WebSocket opened during the opening handshake is closed
* the _extended handshake failed_
* the Sec-WebSocket-Extensions selected by the server are not a subset of those requested
* the extended handshake response does not end with an empty WebSocket binary frame

At this point, if the WebSocket is not closed, it is said that the _extended handshake is completed_.

### Kaazing Extended Handshake Response Codes
This section captures the expected interpretation of the extended response by the client for each of the following embedded extended HTTP response code.  The definitions for the HTTP response codes were taken from the [List of HTTP Status Codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) on Wikipedia 10/20/2011.

#### 1xx Informational

Request received, continuing process.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#cite_note-RFC_2616-1)

This class of status code indicates a provisional response, consisting only of the Status-Line and optional headers, and is terminated by an empty line. Since HTTP/1.0 did not define any 1xx status codes, serversmust not send a 1xx response to an HTTP/1.0 client except under experimental conditions.

| | |
| ---- | ----|
| HTTP Response Code | 100 Continue <br> This means that the server has received the request headers, and that the client should proceed to send the request body (in the case of a request for which a body needs to be sent; for example, a [POST](https://bit.ly/1dWx8n5) request. If the request body is large, sending it to a server when a request has already been rejected based upon inappropriate headers is inefficient. To have a server check if the request could be accepted based on the request's headers alone, a client must send Expect: 100-continue as a header in its initial request[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#cite_note-RFC_2616-1) and check if a 100 Continue status code is received in response before continuing (or receive 417 Expectation Failed and not continue).[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#cite_note-RFC_2616-1) |
| Extended Handshake Action | If the client requests this with an Expect: header, and the WebSocket server supports it, then this is a valid extended handshake response code, actionable on the client which MUST send the request body. |

| | |
| ---- | ---- |
| HTTP Response Code | 101 Switching Protocols <br> This means the requester has asked the server to switch protocols and the server is acknowledging that it will do so.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#cite_note-RFC_2616-1) |
| Extended Handshake Action | Clients receiving a valid WebSocket handshake [WSP] 101 extended response that corresponds to their request MUST consider the _extended handshake completed_. |

| | |
| ---- | ---- |
| HTTP Response Code | 102 Processing [(WebDAV)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV) (RFC 2518) <br> As a WebDAV request may contain many sub-requests involving file operations, it may take a long time to complete the request. This code indicates that the server has received and is processing the request, but no response is available yet.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#cite_note-RFC_2518-2) This prevents the client from timing out and assuming the request was lost. |
| Extended Handshake Action | A Client receiving this response MUST _Close the WebSocket Connection_ following the definition in [WSP]. |

| | |
| --- | --- |
|HTTP Response Code | 103 Checkpoint <br> This code is used in the Resumable HTTP Requests Proposal to resume aborted PUT or POST requests.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#cite_note-ResumableHttpRequestsProposal-3) |
| Extended Handshake Action | A Client receiving this response MUST _Close the WebSocket Connection_ following the definition in [WSP]. |

| | |
| --- | ---|
| HTTP Response Code | 122 Request-URI too long <br> This is a non-standard IE7-only code which means the URI is longer than a maximum of 2083 characters.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#cite_note-4)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#cite_note-5) (See code 414.) |
| Extended Handshake Action | A Client receiving this response MUST _Close the WebSocket Connection_ following the definition in [WSP]. |

#### 2xx Success

This class of status codes indicates the action requested by the client was received, understood, accepted and processed successfully.

| | |
| --- | ---|
| HTTP Response Code | 200 OK <br> Standard response for successful HTTP requests. The actual response will depend on the request method used. In a GET request, the response will contain an entity corresponding to the requested resource. In a POST request the response will contain an entity describing or containing the result of the action.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#cite_note-RFC_2616-1) |
| Extended Handshake Action | A Client receiving this response MUST _Close the WebSocket Connection_ following the definition in [WSP].  The intention of the extended handshake is to receive a 101 upgrade rather than obtain a successful response. |

| | |
| --- | ---|
| HTTP Response Code | 201 Created <br> The request has been fulfilled and resulted in a new resource being created.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#cite_note-RFC_2616-1) |
| Extended Handshake Action | A Client receiving 201 extended response that corresponds to their request MUST consider the _extended handshake completed_.  The intention of the server using this response code rather than a 101 response code indicates that perhaps an emulated or alternative WebSocket has been established.  The content of the response and response headers will determine exactly which. |

| | |
| --- | ---|
| HTTP Response Code | 202 Accepted <br> The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed. The request might or might not eventually be acted upon, as it might be disallowed when processing actually takes place.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#cite_note-RFC_2616-1) |
| Extended Handshake Action | A client receiving this response can choose to wait for up to a maximum amount of time for another response, before _Closing the WebSocket Connection_. |

| | |
| --- | ---|
| HTTP Response Code | 203 Non-Authoritative Information (since HTTP/1.1) <br> The server successfully processed the request, but is returning information that may be from another source.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#cite_note-RFC_2616-1) |
| Extended Handshake Action | A Client receiving this response MUST _Close the WebSocket Connection_ following the definition in [WSP]. |

| | |
| --- | ---|
| HTTP Response Code | 204 No Content <br> The server successfully processed the request, but is not returning any content.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#cite_note-RFC_2616-1) |
| Extended Handshake Action | A Client receiving a 204 extended response that corresponds to their request MUST consider the _extended handshake completed_. |

| | |
| --- | ---|
| HTTP Response Code | 205 Reset Content <br> The server successfully processed the request, but is not returning any content. Unlike a 204 response, this response requires that the requester reset the document view.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#cite_note-RFC_2616-1) |
| Extended Handshake Action | A Client receiving 205 extended response that corresponds to their request MUST consider the _extended handshake completed_. |

| | |
| --- | ---|
| HTTP Response Code | 206 Partial Content <br> The server is delivering only part of the resource due to a range header sent by the client. The range header is used by tools like [wget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wget) to enable resuming of interrupted downloads, or split a download into multiple simultaneous streams.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#cite_note-RFC_2616-1)
| Extended Handshake Action | A Client receiving this response MUST _Close the WebSocket Connection_ following the definition in [WSP]. |

| | |
| --- | ---|
| HTTP Response Code | 207 Multi-Status (WebDAV) (RFC 4918) <br> The message body that follows is an [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) message and can contain a number of separate response codes, depending on how many sub-requests were made.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#cite_note-RFC_4918-6) |
| Extended Handshake Action | A Client receiving this response MUST _Close the WebSocket Connection_ following the definition in [WSP]. |

| | |
| --- | ---|
| HTTP Response Code | 226 IM Used (RFC 3229) <br> The server has fulfilled a GET request for the resource, and the response is a representation of the result of one or more instance-manipulations applied to the current instance. [8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#cite_note-RFC_3229-7) |
| Extended Handshake Action | A Client receiving this response MUST _Close the WebSocket Connection_ following the definition in [WSP]. |

#### 3xx Redirection

The server MUST _Close the WebSocket Connection_ following the definition in [WSP] after sending an extended response with any HTTP status code 3xx.
The client must take additional action to complete the request.[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#cite_note-RFC_2616-1)
This class of status code indicates that further action needs to be taken by the user agent in order to fulfil the request. The action required may be carried out by the user agent without interaction with the user if and only if the method used in the second request is GET or HEAD. A user agent should not automatically redirect a request more than five times, since such redirections usually indicate an [infinite loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_loop).

| | |
| --- | --- |
| HTTP Response Code | 300 Multiple Choices <br> Indicates multiple options for the resource that the client may follow. It, for instance, could be used to present different format options for video, list files with different [extensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filename_extension), or [word sense disambiguation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word-sense_disambiguation).[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#cite_note-RFC_2616-1)
| Extended Handshake Action | A Client receiving this response MUST _Close the WebSocket Connection_ following the definition in [WSP], and SHOULD attempt an opening handshake on one of the given URIs in the choices presented. |

| | |
| --- | --- |
| HTTP Response Code | [301 Moved Permanently](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_301) <br> This and all future requests should be directed to the given [URI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_resource_identifier).[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#cite_note-RFC_2616-1) |
| Extended Handshake Action | A Client receiving this response MUST _Close the WebSocket Connection_ following the definition in [WSP], and SHOULDattempt an opening handshake on the given URI. |

| | |
| --- | --- |
| HTTP Response Code | [302 Found](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_302) <br> This is an example of industrial practice contradicting the standard.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#cite_note-RFC_2616-1) HTTP/1.0 specification (RFC 1945) required the client to perform a temporary redirect (the original describing phrase was "Moved Temporarily"),[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#cite_note-RFC_1945-8) but popular browsers implemented 302 with the functionality of a 303 See Other. Therefore, HTTP/1.1 added status codes 303 and 307 to distinguish between the two behaviours.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#cite_note-RFC2616-10-9) However, some Web applications and frameworks use the 302 status code as if it were the 303. |
| Extended Handshake Action | A Client receiving this response MUST _Close the WebSocket Connection_ following the definition in [WSP], and SHOULD attempt an opening handshake on the given URI. |

| | |
| --- | --- |
| HTTP Response Code | [303 See Other](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_303) (since HTTP/1.1) <br> The response to the request can be found under another [URI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_303) using a GET method. When received in response to a POST (or PUT/DELETE), it should be assumed that the server has received the data and the redirect should be issued with a separate GET message.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#cite_note-RFC_2616-1) |
| Extended Handshake Action | A Client receiving this response MUST _Close the WebSocket Connection_ following the definition in [WSP], and attempt an opening handshake on the given URI. |

| | |
| --- | --- |
| HTTP Response Code | 304 Not Modified <br> Indicates the resource has not been modified since last requested.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#cite_note-RFC_2616-1) Typically, the HTTP client provides a header like the If-Modified-Since header to provide a time against which to compare. Using this saves bandwidth and reprocessing on both the server and client, as only the header data must be sent and received in comparison to the entirety of the page being re-processed by the server, then sent again using more bandwidth of the server and client. |
| Extended Handshake Action | A Client receiving this response MUST _Close the WebSocket Connection_ following the definition in [WSP] |

| | |
| --- | --- |
| HTTP Response Code | 305 Use Proxy (since HTTP/1.1) <br> Many HTTP clients (such as [Mozilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#cite_note-mozilla_bugzilla_bug_187996-10) and [Internet Explorer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer)) do not correctly handle responses with this status code, primarily for security reasons.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#cite_note-RFC_2616-1) |
| Extended Handshake Action | A Client receiving this response MUST _Close the WebSocket Connection_ following the definition in [WSP] |

| | |
| --- | --- |
| HTTP Response Code | 306 Switch Proxy <br> No longer used.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#cite_note-RFC_2616-1) Originally meant "Subsequent requests should use the specified proxy."[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#cite_note-11) |
| Extended Handshake Action | A Client receiving this response MUST _Close the WebSocket Connection_ following the definition in [WSP] |

| | |
| --- | --- |
| HTTP Response Code | 307 Temporary Redirect (since HTTP/1.1) <br> In this occasion, the request should be repeated with another URI, but future requests can still use the original URI.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#cite_note-RFC_2616-1) In contrast to 303, the request method should not be changed when reissuing the original request. For instance, a POST request must be repeated using another POST request. |
| Extended Handshake Action | A Client receiving this response MUST _Close the WebSocket Connection_ following the definition in [WSP].  If and only if the underlying HTTP method was a GET request, the client MUST attempt an opening handshake on the given URI. |

| | |
| --- | --- |
| HTTP Response Code | 308 Resume Incomplete <br> This code is used in the Resumable HTTP Requests Proposal to resume aborted PUT or POST requests.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#cite_note-ResumableHttpRequestsProposal-3) |
| Extended Handshake Action | A Client receiving this response MUST _Close the WebSocket Connection_ following the definition in [WSP] |

#### 4xx Client Error

The 4xx class of status code is intended for cases in which the client seems to have erred. Except when responding to a HEAD request, the server should include an entity containing an explanation of the error situation, and whether it is a temporary or permanent condition. These status codes are applicable to any request method. User agents should display any included entity to the user. These are typically the most common error codes encountered while online.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| HTTP Response Code | 400 Bad Request <br> The request cannot be fulfilled due to bad syntax.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#cite_note-RFC_2616-1) |
| Extended Handshake Action | A Client receiving this response MUST _Close the WebSocket Connection_ following the definition in [WSP] |

| | |
| --- | --- |
| HTTP Response Code | 401 Unauthorized <br> Similar to 403 Forbidden, but specifically for use when authentication is possible but has failed or not yet been provided.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#cite_note-RFC_2616-1) The response must include a WWW-Authenticate header field containing a challenge applicable to the requested resource. See [Basic access authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication) and [Digest access authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digest_access_authentication). |
| Extended Handshake Action | Clients receiving a 401 extended response SHOULD continue the extended handshake, and reply with a replayed extended handshake request containing additional authorization information.  If the client fails to reply in a timely manner, it is the serverâ€™s responsibility to _Close the WebSocket Connection_. |

| | |
| --- | --- |
| HTTP Response Code | 402 Payment Required <br> Reserved for future use.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#cite_note-RFC_2616-1) The original intention was that this code might be used as part of some form of [digital cash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_currency) or [micropayment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micropayment) scheme, but that has not happened, and this code is not usually used. As an example of its use, however, Apple's MobileMe service generates a 402 error ("httpStatusCode:402" in the Mac OS X Console log) if the MobileMe account is delinquent. |
| Extended Handshake Action | A Client receiving this response MUST _Close the WebSocket Connection_ following the definition in [WSP] |

| | |
| --- | --- |
| HTTP Response Code | [403 Forbidden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_403) <br> The request was a legal request, but the server is refusing to respond to it.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#cite_note-RFC_2616-1) Unlike a 401 Unauthorized response, authenticating will make no difference.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#cite_note-RFC_2616-1) |
| Extended Handshake Action | A Client receiving this response MUST _Close the WebSocket Connection_ following the definition in [WSP] |

| | |
| --- | --- |
| HTTP Response Code | [404 Not Found](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404) <br> The requested resource could not be found but may be available again in the future.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#cite_note-RFC_2616-1) Subsequent requests by the client are permissible. |
| Extended Handshake Action | A Client receiving this response MUST _Close the WebSocket Connection_ following the definition in [WSP] |

| | |
| --- | --- |
| HTTP Response Code | 405 Method Not Allowed <br> A request was made of a resource using a request method not supported by that resource;[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#cite_note-RFC_2616-1) for example, using GET on a form which requires data to be presented via POST, or using PUT on a read-only resource. |
| Extended Handshake Action | A Client receiving this response MUST _Close the WebSocket Connection_ following the definition in [WSP] |

| | |
| --- | --- |
| HTTP Response Code | 406 Not Acceptable <br> The requested resource is only capable of generating content not acceptable according to the Accept headers sent in the request.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#cite_note-RFC_2616-1) |
| Extended Handshake Action | A Client receiving this response MUST _Close the WebSocket Connection_ following the definition in [WSP] |

| | |
| --- | --- |
| HTTP Response Code | 407 Proxy Authentication Required <br> The client must first authenticate itself with the proxy.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#cite_note-RFC_2616-1)
| Extended Handshake Action | A Client receiving this response MUST _Close the WebSocket Connection_ following the definition in [WSP], and MAY choose to attempt to authenticate with a proxy. |

| | |
| --- | --- |
| HTTP Response Code | 408 Request Timeout <br> The server timed out waiting for the request.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#cite_note-RFC_2616-1) According to W3 HTTP specifications: "The client did not produce a request within the time that the server was prepared to wait. The client MAY repeat the request without modifications at any later time." |
| Extended Handshake Action | A Client receiving this response MUST _Close the WebSocket Connection_ following the definition in [WSP]. |

| | |
| --- | --- |
| HTTP Response Code | 409 Conflict <br> Indicates that the request could not be processed because of conflict in the request, such as an [edit conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit_conflict).[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#cite_note-RFC_2616-1) |
| Extended Handshake Action | A Client receiving this response MUST _Close the WebSocket Connection_ following the definition in [WSP] |

| | |
| --- | --- |
| HTTP Response Code | 410 Gone <br> Indicates that the resource requested is no longer available and will not be available again.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#cite_note-RFC_2616-1) This should be used when a resource has been intentionally removed and the resource should be purged. Upon receiving a 410 status code, the client should not request the resource again in the future. Clients such as search engines should remove the resource from their indices. Most use cases do not require clients and search engines to purge the resource, and a "404 Not Found" may be used instead. |
| Extended Handshake Action | A Client receiving this response MUST _Close the WebSocket Connection_ following the definition in [WSP] |
